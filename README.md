# Abstract:
 We have been hired by a Brazilian E-commerce company because they cannot understand the trends between repeat customers and customer satisfaction using regression and sentiment analysis. We also plan to use machine learning to advise them on business-related decisions and provide sales predictions.

 2.Predicting customer lifetime value
 3.Predicting future purchases

# Non-goals
 1.Developing new products
 2.Reducing operating costs
 3.Increasing website traffic
 4.Improving manufacturing efficiency

# Data Sources:
